summary:
  background: |
    Sexual offenders often present with diverse risk profiles requiring differentiated interventions [@knuth84].
  methods: |
    We conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating a web-based relapse prevention tool. The trial was prospectively registered on April 24, 2020 in the [German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS00021256)](https://drks.de/search/en/trial/DRKS00021256).
  findings: |
    Preliminary findings suggest significant reductions in dynamic risk factors.
  interpretations: |
    Taken together, the intervention did not lead to measurable changes in the primary CARES outcome but was associated with selected improvements in secondary endpoints — most notably reduced explicit sexual interest and strengthened working alliance with coaches and supervisors — without indications of harm also for low-risk individuals.
  funding: |
    The work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, Funding number: 01KR1807A). The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

panel:
  evidence_before_this_study: |
    This section should include a description of all the evidence that the authors considered before undertaking this study. Authors should state: the sources (databases, journal or book reference lists, etc) searched; the criteria used to include or exclude studies (including the exact start and end dates of the search), which should not be limited to English language publications; the search terms used; the quality (risk of bias) of that evidence; and the pooled estimate derived from meta-analysis of the evidence, if appropriate. Research in context panels should not have references; anything mentioned that needs referencing should appear in the main text.
  added_value_of_this_study: |
    Authors should describe here how their findings add value to the existing evidence (including an updated meta-analysis, if appropriate).
  implications_of_all_the_available_evidence: |
    Authors should state the implications for practice or policy and future research of their study combined with existing evidence.

data_sharing_statement: "The source code of the web-based intervention, the content of the intervention as well as placebo arm are available online under an open source license after publishing. De-identified data will be made available on reasonable request from the corresponding author (peter.fromberger@medizin.uni-goettingen.de). Data access requests, which can be submitted via email to the corresponding author, must include a detailed description of the research question and aims. Data sharing will be authorized following proposal approval and the execution of a signed data access agreement, strictly for scientific use."
