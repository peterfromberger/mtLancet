summary:
  background: |
    Sexual offenders often present with diverse risk profiles requiring differentiated interventions [@knuth84].
  methods: |
    We conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating a web-based relapse prevention tool. The trial was prospectively registered on April 24, 2020 in the [German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS00021256)](https://drks.de/search/en/trial/DRKS00021256).
  findings: |
    Preliminary findings suggest significant reductions in dynamic risk factors.
  interpretations: |
    Taken together, the intervention did not lead to measurable changes in the primary CARES outcome but was associated with selected improvements in secondary endpoints — most notably reduced explicit sexual interest and strengthened working alliance with coaches and supervisors — without indications of harm also for low-risk individuals.
  funding: |
    The work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, Funding number: 01KR1807A). The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

panel:
  evidence_before_this_study: |
    This section should include a description of all the evidence that the authors considered before undertaking this study. Authors should state: the sources (databases, journal or book reference lists, etc) searched; the criteria used to include or exclude studies (including the exact start and end dates of the search), which should not be limited to English language publications; the search terms used; the quality (risk of bias) of that evidence; and the pooled estimate derived from meta-analysis of the evidence, if appropriate. Research in context panels should not have references; anything mentioned that needs referencing should appear in the main text.
  added_value_of_this_study: |
    Authors should describe here how their findings add value to the existing evidence (including an updated meta-analysis, if appropriate).
  implications_of_all_the_available_evidence: |
    Authors should state the implications for practice or policy and future research of their study combined with existing evidence.

data_sharing_statement: "The source code of the webbased intervention, the content of the intervention as well as placebo arm are available online under an open source licence after publishing. De-identified data will be made available on reasonable request from the corresponding author (peter.fromberger@medizin.uni-goettingen.de). Data access requests, which can be submitted via email to the corresponding author, must include a detailed description of the research question and aims. Data sharing will be authorised following proposal approval and the execution of a signed data access agreement, strictly for scientific use."

  ai_use: "Our statement on the use of ai in the creation of the manuscript: - translation, correct grammar."
  thanks: "The authors would like to thank all participants for their time, trust and willingness to take part in the study. Furthermore, we would like to thank all community supervisors for taking part in the study - the project as well as the clinical trial was only possible with their help and support. The authors are grateful to Matthias Koller, Andreas Hill und Sophie K. Piper for taking part in the DSMB."
