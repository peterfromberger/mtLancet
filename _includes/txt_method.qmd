## Method {#method}

### Study design

The trial follows a concealed, prospective, parallel group, placebo-control trial with 1:1 randomization at a single site in Germany (Human Medical Centre Göttingen, Göttingen). Due to ethical considerations, both treatment arms have been provided as an add-on to Community Supervision as Usual (CSaU). CSaU comprises all orders of the court and treatment as usual (e.g., in-face contacts with supervision officers, therapeutic treatment ordered by court, medical treatment) and ensures the necessary maßnahmen ordered by court to prevent society. This potential confounding variable has been reduced by adding additional psycho-therapeutical treatment and medical treatment as stratum. Data on re-offenses based on criminal records will be assessed in a five-year follow up and reported as soon as the data are available. The trial was prospectively registered on April 24, 2020 in the [German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS00021256)](https://drks.de/search/en/trial/DRKS00021256). The study design has been prospectively published [@frombergerMyTabuAPlaceboControlled2021]. The report follows strictly the CONSORT guidelines for randomized trials [@hopewellCONSORT2025Statement2025] (see ???). The project team was advised by a multidisciplinary team, including a police officer, a supervision officer, and a representative of patients during the clincal trial as well as during development of the HBI.

### Participants

All sexual offenders under community supervision (§§56, 57, 68 StGB) from all German states with the exception of Hamburg, Bremen and Saarland, which are sentenced for at least one case of CSA (§§176 ff StGB) or CSEM (§184b StGB), were eligible for the trial. There exist no exclusion criteria regarding gender. Only persons who are older than 18 years were included. Exclusion criteria are (1) a probation period shorter than 6 months at enrollment, (2) no access to a PC, tablet or smart phone, (3) a severe acute psychiatric disorder (e.g., acute psychosis), (4) a severe cerebro-organic disorder, (5) a severe cognitive impairment, (6) withdrawal of the informed consent. All participants gave written informed consent. The participants were credited with monetary compensation after completing a session if they had saved €15 (or a multiple thereof). The total amount of compensation was €120 when all sessions were completed. However, the participants were told that they would not receive any confirmation of having met the treatment requirements set by the court by taking part in the clinical trial. The clinical trial protocol was approved by the medical ethical board of the University Medical Center Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany, on February 21, 2020 (reference number 16/2/20).

### Randomisation and masking

The clinical trial comprises two parallel groups (intervention group and placebo group). Subjects are randomly allocated to treatment using an allocation ratio of 1:1. The randomization lists are centrally generated using a computerized system (secuTrial®, interActive Systems GmbH, Germany), stratified by the offense type (§176 ff StGB vs. §184 b StGB), type of community supervision, external treatment in addition to community supervison as usual, and static risk to re-offend at baseline (assessed with the modified Static-99, LIT und genauere Erläuterungen noch ergänzen). At screening, each subject receives the next consecutive screening number. At randomization, each subject eligible for study participation receives the next consecutive randomization number according to his stratum from a block of randomization numbers (block size: 4). Due to security reasons, blinding of supervision officers (SOs) and online coaches was not possible. Nevertheless, subjects, outcome adjudicators, members of the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) and data analysts (observer) have been blinded until the end of the data analysis.

### Procedures

The procedure was the same for both trial arms. For the recruitment of participants, scientific staff informed SOs about the clinical trial and asked them to inform eligible individuals under their supervision. For eligible individuals, a meeting with an research assistant took place at the supervision office. During this meeting, the research assistant provided detailed information about the goals and procedure of the trial, data security and advantages or disadvantages of taking part in the trial. If the potential participant was further interested to take part, he or she received an information letter, the informed consent, an intervention agreement, and a letter releasing the supervision officer from the confidentiality obligation. In the intervention agreement, the participant agreed not to commit offenses during the participation and is informed that any violation could lead to exclusion. Furthermore, the research assistant performs the pre-intervention paper-and-pencil questionnaires (see Supplementary Material Table A1) and the participant was asked for allowance to assess officially registered re-offenses in a 5-years follow up. After obtaining the written informed consent, the participant was randomly allocated to one of the trial arms. After allocation, the username as well as the initial password necessary to log in was delivered by post to the supervision officer, who gave it to the participant at their next regular meeting.

After the first log-in, the participant had to go through an introduction section, which explains the usage of the WBI, before he or she can start with the first online module. The WBI was divided into six modules, each module was further divided into four sessions. Participants were advised to log in regularly and work through one session per week. The participants could freely decide when they will work on the session. The next session becomes unlocked, when one week has past since the last session and all guided exercises have been successfully completed. Thus, participants were able to finish each module within 4 weeks considering waiting times. Each session was designed to have a time amount of about 1 hour. In summary, the participant was able to finish the WBI within 24 weeks by investing about at least 24 hours online time (see Supplementary Material Figure A???).

Before and after each module, the pre-specified Questionnaires for this module were provided within the WBI (see Supplementary Material Table A1). Due to ethical reasons, before presenting the questionnaire forms for the primary outcome self reports and the Mood and Risk Questionnaire (MRQ), participants were informed that answers will be viewable by their community supervisor. Only the SOs had access to this data during the trial. After finishing, the participants had access to the WBI one more week to download their individual digital first aid kit and to request the last expense allowance before the account was closed. To prematurely exclude a participant from the clinical trial, the supervision officer had to fill in a questionnaire on exclusion reasons (Exclusion Questionnaire, EQ) in order to request the exclusion of a participant. There was no time constraint defined at which a participant was excluded.

Due to data security aspects, the trial staff had no possibility to contact a participant during the clinical trial directly. All communication with participants takes place within the WBI, communication with supervisors outside the WBI per Email, telephone or in presence. Six month before the end of the clinical trial, all remaining SOs have been pleased to inform participants about the necessity of working as advised on the WBI in order to be able to finish it. Supervisors not logged in within the last month have been automatically reminded by Email.

The theoretical concept, procedures, and content of the trial arms have been published prospectively [@frombergerMyTabuAPlaceboControlled2021]. The intervention arm focused exclusively on psychological meaningful risk factors [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023] (see Figure A?). The WBI builds on already established therapeutic concepts from in-face community-based treatment programs [@brikenPraeventionSexuellenKindesmissbrauchs2017; @wildPreventionSexualChild2020] as well as general cognitive-behavioral treatment concepts. Both programs have been designed for CSA as well as CSEM offenders. Parts relevant to the meaningful risk factors of both in-face programs have been digitalized and parts on risk factors not supported by empirical evidence have been skipped in order to shorten the WBI Supplental Material Tables A2-A3 shows the content of both trial arms (see Supplental Material Tables A2-A3). The WBI was designed for female as well as male participants, but due to a lack of knowledge with regard to specific risk factors for female sex offenders [paper von Safiye???], the content remains identical for women and men. The placebo arm was developed to ensure the same mode, dose, and amount of support and attention by supporting online coaches as in the intervention arm - but the content of the modules was unrelated to meaningful dynamic risk factors. The amount of guided exercises was the same as in both trial arms.

During the clinical trial, in one male and three female online coaches cared the participants. All coaches had a master degree in psychology, one coach ein approbierter Psychotherapeut. Regular meetings between online coaches and an experienced supervisor promoting treatment consistency and regular supervision (once per month) took place.

### Outcomes

Supplementary Material Table A1 shows measurement timepoints for all outcome measures.

#### Primary outcomes

Two primary endpoints have been prospectivevely specified (see SAP SUPPLEMENT). The first was the proportion of officially recorded re-offenses, considered the gold standard for evaluating the treatment efficacy of offender rehabilitation programs [@beechCollaborativeOutcomeData2007]. This endpoint will be assessed five years after the last patient out (September 2030). The second primary endpoint, the Index of Desistance (IoD), was intended to measure the effectiveness of the intervention arm in reducing dynamic risk factors compared to the placebo arm. Originally, the IoD was conceptualized as a composite measure comprising three self-report instruments developed at the outset of the @myTabu project: the Acute-SR, the Stable-SR, and the Checklist of Behavioral Misconduct (CMC) [@nitscheErfassungAkutUnd2022]. However, the evaluation by @nitscheErfassungAkutUnd2022 revealed that the CMC exhibited low internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.53). To improve psychometric quality, a comprehensive item reduction was undertaken. Based on these findings, and deviating from the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), the CMC was excluded from the primary outcome, and only the scales with reduced item sets were retained. Furthermore, we decided to report results for the validated CARES scale instead (see ??? for a detailed analysis of the IoD as defined in the SAP). Accordingly, the primary outcome is now defined as the Child Sexual Abuse Risk Evaluation Self-Report (CARES) scale, a composite instrument integrating the CARES-A, which assesses acute dynamic risk factors, and the CARES-S, which measures stable dynamic risk factors [@sonjaetzlerDevelopmentInitialValidationsubmitted]. The CARES total score is calculated by summing the CARES-A and CARES-S total scores, producing a range from 0 to 102, with higher scores indicating greater severity of both acute and stable dynamic risk factors. The CARES-A scale evaluates seven acute dynamic risk factors associated with sexual reoffending in individuals convicted of at least one (contact or non-contact) sexual offense against children: (1) Preoccupation with Potential Victims, (2) Hostility, (3) Hypersexuality, (4)  Rejection of Control Measures, (5) Emotional Crisis, (6) Loss of Social Support, and (7) Substance Use. Comprising 21 items, the CARES-A yields scores from 0 to 42; higher scores denote more pronounced acute dynamic risk. Reliability coefficients for the CARES-A range from α = .79 to α = .83. Analyses of social desirability revealed no significant correlations between CARES-A scores and either the Exaggeration of Positive Qualities or Negative Qualities [@sonjaetzlerDevelopmentInitialValidationsubmitted].
The CARES-S scale assesses six stable dynamic predictors of sexual recidivism. It consists of 30 items covering: (1) Problematic Sexual Interests, (2) Problematic Emotion-Regulation, (3) Lack of Problem-Solving Skills, (4) Offense-Supportive Cognitions, and (5) Lack of Social Support. Five of these subscales correspond to empirically supported psychological risk factors for sexual recidivism [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023]. The CARES-S total score ranges from 0 to 60; higher scores indicate stronger stable dynamic risk factors. The reduced CARES-S achieved an internal consistency of α = .53. As with the CARES-A, no significant correlations with social desirability measures were found in the evaluation study [@sonjaetzlerDevelopmentInitialValidationsubmitted].

#### Secondary outcomes

To analyze the treatment effects of each individual module, secondary endpoints have been analyzed using the non-parametric Brunner-Munzel test [@brunnerNonparametricBehrensFisherProblem2000] for paired data comparing the pre- and post-module scores and adjusting the p-values using the Bonferroni-Holm’s method to control the family-wise error rate. The effect of each module on the scores corresponding to the secondary endpoints was exploratory further analyzed by fitting linear models with treatment group and the randomization strata as factors (offense type, type of CS, external treatment in addition to CSaU), pre module scores as covariate and post module scores as dependent variable if appropriate. If necessary, the scores have been transformed before the analysis. If the assumptions of a linear model were not fulfilled either an ordinal regression model was fitted analogously instead or the score was dichotomized in order to fit a logistic regression model analogously. Analyses on the secondary endpoints were carried out on the specific per-protocol (PP) population. The PP population for a specific module consists of all participants who have completed this module and provided pre- and post module data.

#### Assessment of harms

Stopping guidelines have been prospectively defined for the interim analysis . A participant was excluded if the responsible supervision officer or the online coach reports clear evidence for sexual recidivism or concrete preparations for any sexual recidivism. Re-offenses during participation in the RCT as reported by the community supervisors were derived from the Exclusion Questionnaire (EQ). The EQ assess the reasons for exclusion in a structured manner and had to be filled in by the supervisor during exclusion of a participant (see Supplementary Material for a detailed description). Frequency of recidivism or concrete preparations for recidivism as reported in in-app messages or during working on guided exercises have been assessed continuously (see Supplementary Material Figure A??? - act Critical event).

Potential harms have been assessed by the Mood and Risk Questionnaire (MRQ). The MRQ was developed to assess acute changes with regard to emotional well-being (suicidal ideations, mental crisis) and thoughts associated with potential re-offenses (see Supplementary Material XXX).The MRQ has not been mentioned in the SAP due to a mistake by the PI.

To table: It consists of ten self-developed items, of which six are asking about thoughts and behaviors associated with potential re-offenses and four asking about the psychological and emotional state of the participant. The MRQ has been assessed before and after each session of the HBI. The MRQ differs between the items in the pre and post measurements: all items of the pre measurement refer explicitly to the time between finishing last post measurement and before starting the new session (time not working on the HBI). The post measurement explicitly asks for the time during working on the session.

#### Ancillary outcomes

Without predefined hypotheses, some questionnaires have been administered in an explorative manner. The Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised [WAI-SR; @horvathDevelopmentWorkingAlliance1986; @horvathDevelopmentValidationWorking1989] was used to assess therapeutic alliance with online coaches as well as with community supervisors on six timepoints, always after finishing the first session of a module. Changes in psychological well-being have been assessed with the WHO-5 Well-Being Index [WHO-5; @bechMeasuringDimensionPsychological2004]. The WHO-5 was administered before an after each session of the WBI. The WHO-5 has not been mentioned in the SAP due to a mistake by the PI.

In order to assess a possible volunteer-effect, the Questionnaire of Non-Participation (QNP) was developed to assess possible reasons for not taking part in the clinical trial and to assess the baseline characteristics of non-participanmts in order to be able to get a representative baseline for all individuals convicted for CSA or CSEM under community supervision in Germany. Up to now, there exists no official statistic on individuals under community supervision at Germany. The QNP was only administered if a potential participant will not take part in the study but has given informed consent to fill out the QNP.

Finally, the Questionnaire for Acceptance of Technology (ATQ) was administered in order to assess acceptance of technology and its predictors within the framework of this project. Further, the Questionnaire of Subjective Therapy Preconditions [SBV-R; @endresFragebogenSubjektivenBehandlungsvoraussetzungen2010] was used to measures the subscale "pressure of pain" of the multidimensional construct of therapy and treatment preconditions in offenders. These questionnaires were parts of dissertation projects and preliminary data from the intermediate analysis has already been published with regard to the ATQ [@schroderAcceptanceWebBasedIntervention2024; @schroderEngagementWebbasedIntervention2025] or will be published elsewhere.

To table: For the purpose of this study, the original items of the German version [@wilmersDeutschsprachigeVersionWorking2008] were adapted to be suitable for a web-based intervention. The items have to be rated on a five-point Likertscale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) of the original questionnaire ranges from 0.82 to 0.90 [@wilmersDeutschsprachigeVersionWorking2008]. The WAI-SR was used in an adapted version asking for bonding with the supervisor as well as a adapted version asking for therapeutic alliance with the online coach.

To table: The WHO-5 is a self-report questionnaire that measures current mental well-being based on five items  rated on a six-point Likert-scale ranging from 0 (at no time) to 5 (all of the time). The WHO-5 has shown good validity in measuring subjective well-being in clinical studies [@toppWHO5WellbeingIndex2015].

### Sample size

A priori, a rate of 50% of screened participants taking voluntarily part in the clinical trial was assumed. Based on the estimation of responsible ministries of two federal states, it was expected to see 1.165 subjects eligible for participation during the recruitment period of which 50% (n = 582) have been expected to participate in the study. Taking a dropout of 26.4% into account, it was expected to see n = 428 subjects completing the HBI. With n = 214 subjects in both conditions it is possible to detect small effects (d = 0.27) with a power of 80% at a significance level α = 5%.

### Statistical analysis

Data analysis was performed using the software R, version 4.5.0 [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2025]. Interim analysis has been done by the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) on April 20, 2022. For all analyses on the primary and safety endpoints the intention-to-treat (ITT) population will be utilized. The ITT population is defined as all participants who have completed at least one module but not necessarily answered the questionnaires ate the end of module one.

The primary outcome (CARES total score) was analyzed by means of Gaussian linear model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment group, time (six time-points; after each online intervention module), treatment-by-time interaction, and the randomization strata as factors (offense type, type of CS, external treatment in addition to CSaU), baseline measurements (at clearing up) of the outcome and potentially time span from baseline as covariate and the classical IoD as dependent variable. The error terms were assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution with unstructured covariance. Least squares mean changes from baseline are reported for the treatment groups with 95% confidence interval (CI) as well as the difference between the least squares treatment group means with 95% CI and p-value testing the null hypothesis of no treatment effect. A sensitivity analysis on imputed values complemented the analysis. Imputation has been done using multiple reference based imputation followed by ANCOVA models [@wolbersStandardReferencebasedConditional2022]. If discontinuation from study was due to clear evidence for recidivism or concrete preparation for or intention to recidivism (assessed by responsible supervision officer or online coach) the subject receives the maximal value for IoD for the remaining measurements (assuming the worst case of a failed treatment). In all other cases of drop-out, the reason is recorded.

To analyze the treatment effects of each individual module, secondary endpoints have been analyzed using the non-parametric Brunner-Munzel test [@brunnerNonparametricBehrensFisherProblem2000] for paired data comparing the pre- and post-module scores and adjusting the p-values using the Bonferroni-Holm’s method to control the family-wise error rate.

Proportions of occurrences of re-offences during the clinical trial (as assessed by the EQ) were estimated with 95% confidence intervals for both groups using the beta product confidence procedure for right censored data [@fayPointwiseConfidenceIntervals2013] and differences in the proportions between both groups are estimated with 95% confidence intervals using the beta product confidence procedure for right censored data [@fayCombiningOneSampleConfidence2015]. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were estimated to examine time to first recidivism event as reported by supervision officers.

Frequencies and percentages of the scores on the singe-item subscales of the MRQ were provided for each treatment arm by session and differences between arms on each subscale were compared using Fisher’s exact tests and adjusting the p-values using the Bonferroni-Holm’s method to control the family-wise error rate. Only measures of the MRQ after each session are considered since the MRQ pre questionnaires asked explicitly on the time before the session.

Ancilliary outcomes have been analyzed in a exploratory manner. The total score of the WHO-5 was analyzed by means of MMRM with treatment group, time (six time-points; after each online intervention module), treatment-by-time interaction, and the randomization strata as factors (offense type, type of CS, external treatment in addition to CSaU), baseline measurements (at clearing up) of the outcome and potentially time span from baseline as covariate and the WHO-5 total score as dependent variable. The error terms were assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution with unstructured covariance. Least squares mean changes from baseline are reported for the treatment groups with 95% confidence interval (CI) as well as the difference between the least squares treatment group means with 95% CI and p-value testing the null hypothesis of no treatment effect. The same analysis rationale was applied for the WAI-SR.

### Role of funding source

The work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Funding number: 01KR1807A). The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.
